# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
# create a student
Student.create(first_name: "Dwayne", last_name: "Johnson", grade: 99)
